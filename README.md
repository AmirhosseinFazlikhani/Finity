# Fault tolerance library designed for .Net core

# Finity is a lightweight fault tolerance library designed to isolate access to remote resources and services. In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable.
